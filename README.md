Exclusive-NOR Gate
The operation of Exclusive NOR gate is reciprocal to the Exclusive OR gateâ€™s operation. As the basic AND gate implements the Boolean addition , while OR gate implements Boolean multiplication and NOT implements inversion function , there is no such Boolean function defined by the XNOR.This can be derived by basic gates (AND , OR ,NOT).Below shows the diagram of EX-NOR constructed from EX-OR gate.
 
The logic symbol and Boolean expression for the XNOR gate is shown below.
